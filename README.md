## CreateMyToken

Contracts used on [CreateMyToken](https://www.createmytoken.com/) platform.

These contracts were moved from the monorepo to this repo to make it easier to interact with the community.

The three token contracts in this repo are the implementation contracts for which the platform deploys proxies for. The LM contract is created by Metacrypt and was relicensed to MIT, although the code is included as-is for the sake of completeness.
